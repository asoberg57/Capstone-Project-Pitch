Can trees help reveal the traditional lands of Native Americans? The Oregon white oak plays a vital role in the landscape, culture and history of the Willamette Valley. Historically cultivated and cared for by the Kalapuya people, these trees not only serve as a habitat for the birds and other wildlife, but as a unique feature of Willamette Valley wineries as well. Despite the significance of the oaks, there are no legal protections for the trees. Using data collected by the City of Salem and Willamette University, I hope to develop a machine learnig model that can distinguish Oregon white oaks from other species of trees, as well as determine the oldest of the oaks.

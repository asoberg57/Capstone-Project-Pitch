<p>Can machine learning help us identify the current abundance of one of Oregonâ€™s most significant trees to the cultural and natural history of the Willamette Valley? The Willamette Valley is the traditional home of the Kalapuya people and the local oak has been important in sustaining them since time immemorial. Today that oak is called the Oregon Oak, Oregon White Oak, Garry Oak, or Quercus garryana. The Oregon Oak thrived across the Willamette Valley in a landscape that was managed by the Kalapuya using fire to keep the valley floor in an open savannah habitat. With the arrival of European settlers, the traditional ecological patterns were broken as the fire was suppressed and savannah were converted into European agricultural practices. Since 1850, 97% of the native Oregon Oaks have disappeared with the large wide-reaching branches of the savannah form of the Oregon Oak becoming the rarest. Although the productive open land that originally drew people to the Willamette Valley is vanishing, many landowners have retained the legacy trees of the trees that were signatures of the landscape managed by the Kalapuya. This project proposes using a combination of historical data about colonial-settler land use, current municipal data about street trees, and data from others interested in the conservation of Oregon Oaks to develop a machine learning program to identity all of the undocumented legacy oaks in the Willamette Valley. The benefits of this new tool will be useful for government and nonprofit managers of biodiversity that is dependent on Oregon Oaks. The project will also be valuable for everyone that has a cultural connection to Oregon Oaks and the history of the Willamette Valley.</p>
